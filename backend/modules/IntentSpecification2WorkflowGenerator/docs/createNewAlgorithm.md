# Add a new algorithm to the ontology

## Information needed


* Algorithm name  (k-means, dbscan, etc.)
* Task that the algorithm solves (classification, clustering, normalization, etc.)
* Input objects (data, model, etc.) and order of injection 
* Input objects preconditions (normalized data, splitted, no null, etc.)
* Output objects (data, model, etc.) and order of ejection
* Output objects postconditions (normalized data, splitted, no null, etc.)
* Extra parameters the algorithm needs a part from data or models (random seed, etc.) [optional]
* Implementation engine


## Steps

1. Choose one engine from [`ontology_populator/implementations/`](../ontology_populator/implementations/) or [implement a new one](./addNewEngine.md)
2. Create a new file on: `ontology_populator/implementations/<chosen enigne>/algorithm_name.py`.
3. In that file create, at least, one implementation and one component. You must use the component and implementation definitions specific to the engine being used. Use an existing script as a template. NOTE: Split shapes must be the first one defined among all preprocessing shapes.
4. Update `ontology_populator/implementations/<chosen enigne>/__init__.py` accordingly
5. Modify [`ontology_populator/cbox_generator.py`](../ontology_populator/cbox_generator.py). You should update:
    * ```add_algorithms()```: Add the new algorithm referenced by the implementation and the problem it solves.
    * ```add_models()```: Add the new model types generated by the new algorithm, if any.
    * ```add_shapes()```: Add new shapes specified on the implementation and component functions if they are not present in the current ontology.
6. Execute the following command to regenerate the cbox:
    ```bash
    python cbox_generator.py
    ```
7. Overwrite [`ontologies/cbox.ttl`](../ontologies/cbox.ttl) with the newly generated one (it should be automatically done)
