# How to add a new algorithm to the ontology

## Information needed


* Algorithm name  (k-means, dbscan, etc.)
* Task that the algorithm solves (classification, clustering, normalization, etc.)
* Input data fromat preconditions (normalized data, splitted, no null, etc.)
* Input objects (data or model) and order of injection 
* Output objects (data or model) and order of ejection
* Output data format postconditions (normalized data, splitted, no null, etc.)
* Extra parameters the algorithm needs a part from data or models (random seed, etc.)
* Implementation engine (for dsl basic one)


## Steps

1. Choose one engine from [`ontology_populator/implementations/`](../ontology_populator/implementations/)
2. Create Implementation and Component (at lesast one of each)
3. Update `ontology_populator/implementations/<chosen enigne>/__init__.py` accordingly
4. Update [`ontology_populator/cbox_generator.py`](../ontology_populator/cbox_generator.py). You should update:
    * ```add_algorithms()```: Add the new algorithm referenced by the implementation and the problem it solves.
    * ```add_models()```: Add the new model types generated by the new algorithm, if any.
    * ```add_shapes()```: Add new shapes specified on the implementation and component functions if they are not present in the current ontology.
5. Execute the following command to regenerate the cbox:
    ```bash
    python cbox_generator.py
    ```
6. Overwrite [`ontologies/cbox.ttl`](../ontologies/cbox.ttl) with the new generated (it should be automatically done)
